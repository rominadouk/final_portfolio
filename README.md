Smooth Scrolling

This app is a single-page application designed using React and react-smooth-scroll, this is my most up-to-date version of my portfolio created as a final project to mark the end of my journey at General Assembly. This app was created to showcase my skill set by displaying past projects. This portfolio also includes links to my LinkedIn, Github and links to three live projects. This app design was based on wireframes in collaboration with UX/UI designer Christian Jackson. After design was established I mapped out each React component, then began building each element. React-smooth-scroll and react-router-dom were implemented to give a smoother user experience. 

## Future Updates: 
Design changes 
Intro will take up a whole web-frame
Fade-In effects will be implemented when the user first scrolls to the page
